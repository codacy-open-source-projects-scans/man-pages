Name
	deps - software dependencies of this project

Description
	There are different kinds of software dependencies on which this
	project depends.  For maintaining the health of this project,
	the health of those dependencies is also essential.  The
	following lists dependencies as <debian-package>/<binary>.

	Maintenance
		Maintainers need some tools to read and write email,
		manage the git repository, etc.  The essential ones we
		use are:

		-  bash/bash
		-  git/git
		-  git-email/git-send-email
		-  isync/mbsync
		-  less/less
		-  make/make
		-  mutt/mutt
		-  neomutt/neomutt
		-  openssh-client/ssh
		-  openssh-server/sshd
		-  pass/pass
		-  pass-otp/otp.bash
		-  vim/vim
		-  xfce4-terminal/xfce4-terminal

		Of course, the OS is also a dependency.
		Devuan GNU+Linux is the OS of choice of the current
		maintainer.

	Build
		To build the project, there are many dependencies, some
		of which are strictly necessary, and others which
		improve the quality (such as linters).

		This list can be generated by the build system itself.
		Run the following command to print this list:

			$ make -R help-list-build-depends

	Run-time
		To read the manual pages, one needs two things:

		Formatter
			Several formatters exist.  Any of them should
			work, more or less.  However, only two of them
			are officially supported; and of these two,
			groff typically has better support.

			-  groff/groff
			-  mandoc/mandoc

		Librarian
			Also several librarians exist.  Any of them
			should work.  man-db has better support.

			-  man-db/man
			-  mandoc/mman
