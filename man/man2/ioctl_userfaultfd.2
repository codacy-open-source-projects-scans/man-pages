.TH ioctl_userfaultfd 2 (date) "Linux man-pages (unreleased)"
.SH NAME
ioctl_userfaultfd \- create a file descriptor for handling page faults in user
space
.SH LIBRARY
Standard C library
.RI ( libc ", " \-lc )
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#include <linux/userfaultfd.h>" "  /* Definition of " UFFD* " constants */"
.B #include <sys/ioctl.h>
.P
.BI "int ioctl(int " fd ", int " op ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Various
.BR ioctl (2)
operations can be performed on a userfaultfd object (created by a call to
.BR userfaultfd (2))
using calls of the form:
.P
.in +4n
.EX
ioctl(fd, op, argp);
.EE
.in
.P
In the above,
.I fd
is a file descriptor referring to a userfaultfd object,
.I op
is one of the operations listed below, and
.I argp
is a pointer to a data structure that is specific to
.IR op .
.P
The various
.BR ioctl (2)
operations are described below.
The
.BR UFFDIO_API ,
.BR UFFDIO_REGISTER ,
and
.B UFFDIO_UNREGISTER
operations are used to
.I configure
userfaultfd behavior.
These operations allow the caller to choose what features will be enabled and
what kinds of events will be delivered to the application.
The remaining operations are
.I range
operations.
These operations enable the calling application to resolve page-fault
events.
.\"
.SS UFFDIO_API
(Since Linux 4.3.)
Enable operation of the userfaultfd and perform API handshake.
.P
The
.I argp
argument is a pointer to a
.I uffdio_api
structure, defined as:
.P
.in +4n
.EX
struct uffdio_api {
    __u64 api;        /* Requested API version (input) */
    __u64 features;   /* Requested features (input/output) */
    __u64 ioctls;     /* Available ioctl() operations (output) */
};
.EE
.in
.P
The
.I api
field denotes the API version requested by the application.
The kernel verifies that it can support the requested API version,
and sets the
.I features
and
.I ioctls
fields to bit masks representing all the available features and the generic
.BR ioctl (2)
operations available.
.P
Since Linux 4.11,
applications should use the
.I features
field to perform a two-step handshake.
First,
.B UFFDIO_API
is called with the
.I features
field set to zero.
The kernel responds by setting all supported feature bits.
.P
Applications which do not require any specific features
can begin using the userfaultfd immediately.
Applications which do need specific features
should call
.B UFFDIO_API
again with a subset of the reported feature bits set
to enable those features.
.P
Before Linux 4.11, the
.I features
field must be initialized to zero before the call to
.BR UFFDIO_API ,
and zero (i.e., no feature bits) is placed in the
.I features
field by the kernel upon return from
.BR ioctl (2).
.P
If the application sets unsupported feature bits,
the kernel will zero out the returned
.I uffdio_api
structure and return
.BR EINVAL .
.P
The following feature bits may be set:
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_FORK " (since Linux 4.11)"
When this feature is enabled,
the userfaultfd objects associated with a parent process are duplicated
into the child process during
.BR fork (2)
and a
.B UFFD_EVENT_FORK
event is delivered to the userfaultfd monitor
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMAP " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature is enabled,
when the faulting process invokes
.BR mremap (2),
the userfaultfd monitor will receive an event of type
.BR UFFD_EVENT_REMAP .
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMOVE " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature is enabled,
when the faulting process calls
.BR madvise (2)
with the
.B MADV_DONTNEED
or
.B MADV_REMOVE
advice value to free a virtual memory area
the userfaultfd monitor will receive an event of type
.BR UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE .
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_UNMAP " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature is enabled,
when the faulting process unmaps virtual memory either explicitly with
.BR munmap (2),
or implicitly during either
.BR mmap (2)
or
.BR mremap (2),
the userfaultfd monitor will receive an event of type
.BR UFFD_EVENT_UNMAP .
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_MISSING_HUGETLBFS " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports registering userfaultfd ranges on hugetlbfs
virtual memory areas
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_MISSING_SHMEM " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports registering userfaultfd ranges on shared memory areas.
This includes all kernel shared memory APIs:
System V shared memory,
.BR tmpfs (5),
shared mappings of
.IR /dev/zero ,
.BR mmap (2)
with the
.B MAP_SHARED
flag set,
.BR memfd_create (2),
and so on.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS " (since Linux 4.14)"
.\" commit 2d6d6f5a09a96cc1fec7ed992b825e05f64cb50e
If this feature bit is set, no page-fault events
.RB ( UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT )
will be delivered.
Instead, a
.B SIGBUS
signal will be sent to the faulting process.
Applications using this
feature will not require the use of a userfaultfd monitor for processing
memory accesses to the regions registered with userfaultfd.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_THREAD_ID " (since Linux 4.14)"
If this feature bit is set,
.I uffd_msg.pagefault.feat.ptid
will be set to the faulted thread ID for each page-fault message.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WP " (since Linux 5.10)"
If this feature bit is set,
userfaultfd supports write-protect faults
for anonymous memory.
(Note that shmem / hugetlbfs support
is indicated by a separate feature.)
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_MINOR_HUGETLBFS " (since Linux 5.13)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports registering userfaultfd ranges
in minor mode on hugetlbfs-backed memory areas.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_MINOR_SHMEM " (since Linux 5.14)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports registering userfaultfd ranges
in minor mode on shmem-backed memory areas.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EXACT_ADDRESS " (since Linux 5.18)"
If this feature bit is set,
.I uffd_msg.pagefault.address
will be set to the exact page-fault address that was reported by the hardware,
and will not mask the offset within the page.
Note that old Linux versions might indicate the exact address as well,
even though the feature bit is not set.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_WP_HUGETLBFS_SHMEM " (since Linux 5.19)"
If this feature bit is set,
userfaultfd supports write-protect faults
for hugetlbfs and shmem / tmpfs memory.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_WP_UNPOPULATED " (since Linux 6.4)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel will handle anonymous memory the same way as file memory,
by allowing the user to write-protect unpopulated page table entries.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_POISON " (since Linux 6.6)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports resolving faults with the
.B UFFDIO_POISON
ioctl.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ASYNC " (since Linux 6.7)"
If this feature bit is set,
the write protection faults would be asynchronously resolved
by the kernel.
.P
The returned
.I ioctls
field can contain the following bits:
.\" FIXME This user-space API seems not fully polished. Why are there
.\" not constants defined for each of the bit-mask values listed below?
.TP
.B 1 << _UFFDIO_API
The
.B UFFDIO_API

The
.B UFFDIO_REGISTER
operation is supported.
.TP
.B 1 << _UFFDIO_UNREGISTER
The
.B UFFDIO_UNREGISTER
operation is supported.
.P
This
.BR ioctl (2)
operation returns 0 on success.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
If an error occurs,
the kernel may zero the provided
.I uffdio_api
structure.
The caller should treat its contents as unspecified,
and reinitialize it before re-attempting another
.B UFFDIO_API
call.
Possible errors include:
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I argp
refers to an address that is outside the calling process's
accessible address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The API version requested in the
.I api
field is not supported by this kernel, or the
.I features
field passed to the kernel includes feature bits that are not supported
by the current kernel version.
.TP
.B EINVAL
A previous
.B UFFDIO_API
call already enabled one or more features for this userfaultfd.
Calling
.B UFFDIO_API
twice,
the first time with no features set,
is explicitly allowed
as per the two-step feature detection handshake.
.TP
.B EPERM
The
.B UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_FORK
feature was enabled,
but the calling process doesn't have the
.B CAP_SYS_PTRACE
capability.
.SS UFFDIO_REGISTER
(Since Linux 4.3.)
Register a memory address range with the userfaultfd object.
The pages in the range must be \[lq]compatible\[rq].
Please refer to the list of register modes below
for the compatible memory backends for each mode.
.P
The
.I argp
argument is a pointer to a
.I uffdio_register
structure, defined as:
.P
.in +4n
.EX
struct uffdio_range {
    __u64 start;    /* Start of range */
    __u64 len;      /* Length of range (bytes) */
};
\&
struct uffdio_register {
    struct uffdio_range range;
    __u64 mode;     /* Desired mode of operation (input) */
    __u64 ioctls;   /* Available ioctl() operations (output) */
};
.EE
.in
.P
The
.I range
field defines a memory range starting at
.I start
and continuing for
.I len
bytes that should be handled by the userfaultfd.
.P
The

to return the number of bytes that were actually poisoned,
or an error in the same manner as
.BR UFFDIO_COPY .
If the value returned in the
.I updated
field doesn't match the value that was specified in
.IR range.len ,
the operation fails with the error
.BR EAGAIN .
The
.I updated
field is output-only;
it is not read by the
.B UFFDIO_POISON
operation.
.P
This
.BR ioctl (2)
operation returns 0 on success.
In this case,
the entire area was poisoned.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
Possible errors include:
.TP
.B EAGAIN
The number of bytes mapped
(i.e., the value returned in the
.I updated
field)
does not equal the value that was specified in the
.I range.len
field.
.TP
.B EINVAL
Either
.I range.start
or
.I range.len
was not a multiple of the system page size; or
.I range.len
was zero; or the range specified was invalid.
.TP
.B EINVAL
An invalid bit was specified in the
.I mode
field.
.TP
.B EEXIST
One or more pages were already mapped in the given range.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The faulting process has changed its virtual memory layout simultaneously with
an outstanding
.B UFFDIO_POISON
operation.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Allocating memory for page table entries failed.
.TP
.B ESRCH
The faulting process has exited at the time of a
.B UFFDIO_POISON
operation.

.SH RETURN VALUE
See descriptions of the individual operations, above.
.SH ERRORS
See descriptions of the individual operations, above.
In addition, the following general errors can occur for all of the
operations described above:
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I argp
does not point to a valid memory address.
.TP
.B EINVAL
(For all operations except
.BR UFFDIO_API .)
The userfaultfd object has not yet been enabled (via the
.B UFFDIO_API
operation).
.SH STANDARDS
Linux.
.SH BUGS
In order to detect available userfault features and
enable some subset of those features
the userfaultfd file descriptor must be closed after the first
.B UFFDIO_API
operation that queries features availability and reopened before
the second
.B UFFDIO_API
operation that actually enables the desired features.
