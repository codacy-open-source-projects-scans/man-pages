Description
    Developer's Certificate of Origin
	Sign your patch with "Signed-off-by:".  Read about the
	"Developer's Certificate of Origin" at
	<https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst>.
	When appropriate, other tags documented in that file, such as
	"Reported-by:", "Reviewed-by:", "Acked-by:", and "Suggested-by:"
	can be added to the patch.  We use "Co-authored-by:" instead of
	"Co-developed-by:".  Example:

		Signed-off-by: Alejandro Colomar <alx@kernel.org>

    Fixes
	Add 'Fixes:' tags as necessary.  'Fixes:' trailer fields should
	have the following format.

		Fixes: 12-char-hash ([author-date,] commit-date; "subject")

	where the author date is optional, and only included if it's
	somehow important.  The commit date is often more important, as
	it's sorted, and thus can be used to find (with a binary search)
	a commit whose hash and subject may have collisions.  For
	example:

		Fixes: bb509e6fcbae (2020-10-16; "kernel_lockdown.7: New page documenting the Kernel Lockdown feature")

	See <CONTRIBUTING.d/git> for how to configure the alias.ref and
	alias.ref2 git aliases.  The commit references can be produced
	with them.

		$ git ref bb509e6fc
		bb509e6fcbae (2020-10-16; "kernel_lockdown.7: New page documenting the Kernel Lockdown feature")
