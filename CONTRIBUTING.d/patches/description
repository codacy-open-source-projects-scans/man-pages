Description
	The descrpiption of a patch is commonly known as commit message.
	it should describe the patch, including any details that may be
	of importance for its review.  It is formed by the subject, a
	blank line, the body, a blank line, and the trailer.

    Subject
	See <CONTRIBUTING.d/patches/subject>.

    Body
	Describe how you obtained the information in your patch.  For
	example, was it:

	-  by reading (or writing) the relevant kernel or (g)libc source
	   code?  Please provide a pointer to the relevant code.

	-  from a commit message in the kernel or (g)libc source code
	   repository?  Please provide a commit ID.

	-  by writing a test program?  Send it with the patch, but
	   please make sure it's as simple as possible, and provide
	   instructions on how to use it and/or a demo run.

	-  from a standards document?  Please name the standard, and
	   quote the relevant text.

	-  from other documentation?  Please provide a pointer to that
	   documentation.

	-  from a mailing list or online forum?  Please provide a URL
	   if possible.

	Where relevant, cite commit hashes for relevant kernel or glibc
	changes:

		linux.git f4b89d8ce5a8 ("landlock: Various documentation improvements")

    Style guide
	URIs should always be enclosed in <>.

	The correct inter-sentence space amount is two.  See some

    Trailer
	Sign your patch with "Signed-off-by:".  Read about the
	"Developer's Certificate of Origin" at
	<https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst>.
	When appropriate, other tags documented in that file, such as
	"Reported-by:", "Reviewed-by:", "Acked-by:", and "Suggested-by:"
	can be added to the patch.  We use "Co-authored-by:" instead of
	"Co-developed-by:".  Example:

		Signed-off-by: Alejandro Colomar <alx@kernel.org>
